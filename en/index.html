        <h2 id="help">How to Play Minesweeper</h2>
        <p>On mobile devices, you can zoom in and drag the canvas to play. Enabling the auto-flag mode makes it easier to play on your phone. iOS users can add this page to their home screen in Safari for quick access.</p>
        <p>Use the "Game" menu to change the difficulty level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Left-click:</strong> When in "Dig" mode (default), uncover a square. When in "Flag" mode, place or remove a red flag. When in "Mark" mode, add or remove a temporary colored mark on a square (the mark will be removed automatically when the square is uncovered).</li>
            <li><strong>Right-click:</strong> Place a red flag to mark a potential mine, click again to remove the flag.</li>
            <li><strong>Click on numbers:</strong> Left-click on an uncovered number to reveal all surrounding squares, as long as you have marked enough mines around that number.</li>
            <li><strong>New game:</strong> Click the smiley face or the sad face to start a new game.</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Flag:</strong> You can turn the auto-flag feature on or off in the "Game" menu.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Minesweeper Rules</h2>
        <p>Minesweeper is a game of chance, but not entirely! There are patterns and strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The board: The Minesweeper board contains two types of squares: safe squares and squares containing mines.</li>
            <li>Goal: Find all the mines! More precisely, explore all the squares while avoiding the mines. The winning condition is to <strong>uncover all the safe squares</strong>, not just mark all the mine-containing squares.</li>
            <li>Avoiding mines: By using the information provided by the safe squares, you can deduce whether a surrounding square contains a mine or not.</li>
            <li>Types of safe squares:
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers: Indicate the number of mines in the <strong>eight surrounding squares</strong>. In the image below, the red square with the number 2 means that there are 2 mines in the eight squares around it, which are marked with red flags.</li>
                    <img loading="lazy" src="/src/assets/rule-number-neighbor.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the eight surrounding squares of a number" width="100" height="102" />
                    <li>Blank: Indicates that there are no mines in the surrounding squares. When you click on a blank square, it will automatically uncover the adjacent squares.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Minesweeper Tips and Strategies</h2>
        <p>For beginners: Start by using the number information to find some mines (it's recommended to turn off the "Auto-Flag" mode to practice finding mines yourself).</p>
        <p>Next step: Combine information from 2-3 numbers to find mines that are not as obvious (if you have the "Auto-Flag" mode on, the obvious mines will be automatically marked, so you'll need to use your reasoning and analysis skills for the remaining squares).</p>
        <p>Third step: Start recognizing and summarizing common patterns to improve your speed.</p>
        <p>While many patterns have already been documented, discovering and summarizing them yourself is part of the fun of Minesweeper. Enjoy the process!</p>
